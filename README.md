# ThreeSixtyPlayer


:construction: This is very much a work in progress :construction:

###Overview
This is a 360 video viewer for iOS, implemented using [SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SceneKit_Framework/).

SceneKit is probably the highest level iOS API that can be used for this sort of thing. I chose this approach to refamiliarize myself with the ins and outs of graphics programming. I plan to move on to a [Metal-based](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) implementation next. 

###Usage

Coming soon...
